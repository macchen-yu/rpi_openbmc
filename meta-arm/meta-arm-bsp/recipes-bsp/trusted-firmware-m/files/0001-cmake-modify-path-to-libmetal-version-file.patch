Subject: [PATCH] cmake: modify path to libmetal version file

Commit ad87802d6e01e97946de20b6c2fa28aed184ed20 changed how the
versioning is done and created a version file.  Due to this change,
the VERSION file is not being found when building because the source dir
is pointing to tf-m.  Modify to point where we want it.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [Build workaround]
